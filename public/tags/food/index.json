[{"content":"Its Friday, July 29th, 2022. I\u0026rsquo;m a little sad. I\u0026rsquo;m worn out from a week\u0026rsquo;s worth of fighting with myself, a week\u0026rsquo;s worth of attempting to marshall myself to get meaningful work done, a week\u0026rsquo;s worth of small victories and defeats, a week\u0026rsquo;s worth of good days and bad days, a week\u0026rsquo;s worth of reaching out to friends over text, and most of us being too busy or tired from work to respond to each other. I\u0026rsquo;m worn out from working out hard, and winning and losing at diet. I\u0026rsquo;m worn out from having more to do, and accomplish than I could ever reasonably accomplish in one lifetime. Why do I need to accomplish so much? Well I have to become a sterling bright and beautiful bird, right? How else will the girls know that I\u0026rsquo;m that i\u0026rsquo;m the one for them.\nYeah, well, I am married. So, why am I doing all this again? Oh yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna die one day, I have to do something meaningful with my life. And why is it meaningful to toil away on becoming a better me? A better me for who? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that point of the human struggle? The power of the individual is that by rising above they help the community. The indivudual strives for the community. Where is my community? Where are the human connections? Maybe this is real death of god - when we lose all context for meaning making\u0026hellip;our social connections.\nWe are a social animal that is sensitively tuned to social reality. This is how your son or daughter is constantly talking in a language you don\u0026rsquo;t understand, because they have a world that you don\u0026rsquo;t inhabit. It was constructed out of thin air. It is a social reality whose fabric is just rules, and different cultural information. So what happens when we lose the ability to play our game - the one that our parents didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to play? What happens when we lose the people we played with? Slowly our social bonds disintegrate as we are worked to the bone, the context for meaning making erodes, and we become a husk that has forgotten the purpose of humanity - to be together. Then, we turn dark. We become suspicious of everything. We hate everything. We hate the outsider. We hate the gays and trans folk. We hate the immigrant. We hate the people that threaten our lives. Because despite the fact that we hate our isolation we still have fight in us, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to die, and we are still worried someone might take the things we care about the most from us. Its too late. We already lost it. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t the immigrants or trans people who took it. We lost community.\nWell, I refuse to become cynical. I\u0026rsquo;m not giving up on people, or myself. I will simply acknowledge that the society I live in undermines itself. Its great hero - the individual - is its great sacrifice. Community is something we can get back. Its a reorientation of purpose. I choose to try to live in service of others this day. This is why we play. We play for each other. We can never forget. I can never forget. When I do, I despair. We can do this. Have a good day! Happy Friday!\n","description":"","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":[""],"title":"Friday Prayer","uri":"https://jdmunger.com/posts/friday_prayer/"},{"content":"Meal Planning Rather than opining and getting grandiose, I\u0026rsquo;ll quickly explain my reasoning behind my meal planning, what i\u0026rsquo;m aiming for, and the items on the list.\nThe inspiration is simple. I\u0026rsquo;ve been experimenting for the past couple of years in the vegan/vegetarian recipe space, and, at this point, I spend too much time improvising, and reacting. I want a more targetted, more intentionally nutritionally balanced meals, and a plan. Having a plan saves time and effort, and I need a more explicit default setting. Because my natural default setting isn\u0026rsquo;t well-balanced.\nBalancing Ideas I want to make meal plans that are simple, memoized or synergistic(ingredients are used in multiple recipes), and nutritionally balanced i.e. balanced macros, and micros if possible.\nI think it makes the most sense to keep these meal plans organized by their main reusable ingredient, so I can add a few together to make a weekly meal plan. My solution are the following lists of synergistic recipes. Basically, I just wrote down all the recipes I know that are the easiest to execute, and sorted them by ingredients.\nPutting my recipes down has forced me to realize something I already knew, which is: I don\u0026rsquo;t eat enough salad or greens, and I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough recipes for some of these categories. However, I\u0026rsquo;m only going to expand the Salads and Greens category, because, as you can see, I have plenty of carbs in my life.\nThe last consideration made explicit by grocking my list of recipes is that I rely too much on eggs for my protein. My reaction to that has been to eat them a couple times a week. If I eat them more than that, I limit myself to one yolk per recipe. But I don\u0026rsquo;t like eggs an egg-whity omelet\u0026rsquo;s taste or consistency so I end up eating fake meats, far more frequently. If plan on having Orgain protein shakes after my workouts. I should probably expand the Tofu section. I should probably try some Seitan stuff.\nWell, I\u0026rsquo;m going to post this unfinished. I plan to add recipes, from my various cook books, and do that expansion I referenced. But for now, this at least does the grouping that allows me to organize my shopping list a little better.\nTo be continued.\nContinuing. Hey What happened to that default setting I was talking about? Do I not have it in me to be simple? I do. I default to #EasyAF when I don\u0026rsquo;t want to think about cooking.\nSalad and Greens Lemon Garlic Kale Salad Wedge Salad Braised Romaine Italian Broccoli Salad Chopped Salad with Chickpeas Sauces Chickpeas Falafel Hummus Chickpea Harissa Soup Bulgar Bulgar Ricotta Pancakes Bulgar-Olive Salad Rice Dosa Fried Rice Japanese Curry Roux Red Thai Curry Bibimbap Bowl Dolmas Sushi Bread Garlic Bread Pizza Bahn Mi Tomatoes/Tomatillos/Tortillas Chilaquiles Huevos Rancheros Israeli Breakfast Plate Shakshuka Garlic Bread Pizza Tom Yum Soup Pizza Spaghetti and Meatballs Black Beans Black Bean Burgers Black Bean Tortas Eggs Tamago kake gohan Tamagoyaki Thai omelet Dutch Baby Ragu Bolognese Israeli Breakfast Plate Souffle Pancakes Tofu Bahn Mi Sweet-Sour Tofu Pototoes Potato and Gochujang Braised Eggs French Fries Potato and Egg Omelet Aloo Chutney Lentils Amchur Chana Stuffed Delicata Squash With Lentils and Cashew Raita Noodles SF Garlic Noodles Ragu Bolognese Mapu Tofu Cacio e Pepe vegetable Lo Mein Penne with Carrots, Chanterelles, and Vegan Sausage Kimchi Jjigae One Shots No synergy/Too Complicated to do on the fly\nSichuan \u0026ldquo;Fish-Fragrant\u0026rdquo; Eggplant Noodle Salad with mushroom and peanut laab Seitan Satay Vatapa #EasyAF Boca Burger Protein-Shake Overnight Oats Congee PB and J Smash Burger Bibimbap Bowl Avacado Toast Fish Sandwich Guacamole Rice Miso Soup Cereal Posted 2022-07-22 Updated ","description":"","id":3,"section":"posts","tags":["food","order"],"title":"Meal Plans","uri":"https://jdmunger.com/posts/meal-plan/"},{"content":"Food Expeditions and Creations\n","description":"Food","id":4,"section":"gallery","tags":null,"title":"cooking","uri":"https://jdmunger.com/gallery/cooking/"},{"content":"My name is John Munger.
