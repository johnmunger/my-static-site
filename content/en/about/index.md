My name is John Munger.  I'm a full-stack web developer with Sev1Tech(formerly Geocent). 
I am married.
I am the father of one cat, Chino.
CEO at Esoteric LLC(where I do freelance software dev work).
This website is a place for me to document my hobbies, thoughts, and non-work related projects.

I consume tons of information via podcasts, books, audiobooks, and YouTubers.  I love philosophy and science.  I have always had a philosophical bent. I am a Drummer,  Avid Cook and Cookbook collector.  Board Game Geek.
