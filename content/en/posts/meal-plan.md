# Meal Planning

Rather than opining and getting grandiose, I'll quickly explain my reasoning behind my meal planning, what i'm aiming for, and the items on the list.

The inspiration is simple.  I've been experimenting for the past couple of years in the vegan/vegetarian recipe space, and, at this point, I spend too much time improvising, and reacting.  I want a more targetted, more intentionally nutritionally balanced meals, and a plan.  Having a plan saves time and effort, and I need a more explicit default setting.  Because my natural default setting isn't well-balanced. 


### Balancing Ideas

I want to make meal plans that are simple, memoized or synergistic(ingredients are used in multiple recipes), and nutritionally balanced i.e. balanced macros, and micros if possible.

I think it makes the most sense to keep these meal plans organized by their main reusable ingredient, so I can add a few together to make a weekly meal plan.  My solution are the following lists of synergistic recipes. Basically, I just wrote down all the recipes I know that are the easiest to execute, and sorted them by ingredients.  

Putting my recipes down has forced me to realize something I already knew, which is: I don't eat enough salad or greens, and I don't have enough recipes for some of these categories.  However, I'm only going to expand the Salads and Greens category, because, as you can see, I have plenty of carbs in my life.

The last consideration made explicit by grocking my list of recipes is that I rely too much on eggs for my protein.  My reaction to that has been to eat them a couple times a week.  If I eat them more than that, I limit myself to one yolk per recipe.  But I don't like eggs an egg-whity omelet's taste or consistency so I end up eating fake meats, far more frequently.  If plan on having Orgain protein shakes after my workouts. I should probably expand the Tofu section.  I should probably try some Seitan stuff.

Well, I'm going to post this unfinished. I plan to add recipes, from my various cook books, and do that expansion I referenced.  But for now, this at least does the grouping that allows me to organize my shopping list a little better.

To be continued.

Continuing.  Hey What happened to that default setting I was talking about?  Do I not have it in me to be simple?  I do.  I default to #EasyAF when I don't want to think about cooking.
