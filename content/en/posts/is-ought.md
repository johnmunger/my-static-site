## Quotes 

""I seek God! I seek God!"---As many of those who did not believe in God were standing around just then, he provoked much laughter. "Has he got lost?" asked one. "Did he lose his way like a child?" asked another. "Or is he hiding? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? emigrated?"---Thus they yelled and laughed

The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. "Whither is God?" he cried; "I will tell you. We have killed him---you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how did we do this? How could we drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.

"How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?" - Nietzsche

"The knowledge we now accept as science interferes with more than it supports the goodness of human life.  

Astronomy, mechanics, physics, chemistry, and all other sciences together and differently, all study the particular sides of life, but they do not come to any conclusion about the spiritual life of mankind.

Science fulfills its purpose, not when it explains the reasons for the spots on the sun, but when it understands and explains the laws of our own life,  and the consequences of violating these laws."  - John Ruskin

## Meaninglessness

For those who suffer meaninglessness, maybe this will help you.

*What is* being the measure of truth, and the implications of the is-ought problem lead to meaninglessness

Meaninglessness without wisdom leads to desperation.

Desperate people do stupid things.

The scientific method is how we arrive at our conclusions about what is true about the world.  Religion has historically been the repository for wisdom or how we ought to behave. Nietzsche's death of god demarcates a new era where the value of traditional norms retreat as consequence of a new defintion of knowing - propositional knowing.  Cold knowing.  In fact, anti-knowing.  A disembodied knowing. It is a knowing that lacks personal experience in engagement.  Said another way, most of our knowledge lies in the resositories of someone else's experience.  Importantly, none of the knowledge gleaned through science stands in for religious wisdom.  None of it tells you how to be, how to act, what to do when a parent dies, what not to do.  Why is this? The is-ought problem points out that it is impossible in principle to justify a moral claims through scientific experiment.  This serves as both a caution to those who would claims we can scientifically prove something is the right thing to do(a la Sam Harris's Moral Landscape, or more insidiously, Jordan Peterson's conflation of a description of human morality with its justification), and a liberator from any dogmatism. However, the is-ought problem is a tool supporting Berlinian negative liberty.   Neitzsche's worry is now fully our own.  That is people without religious practice tend to report being less happy. "This explanation fits the data, but we can't be 100% certain." that can the scientific method say about how we ought to behave? Let's skip to the end. Nothing.  Science *can* give us information with which we can pass through our existing values to get more of what we want.  Because people use the word *truth* to describe both the descriptive and the normative, the two domains seem related.  We conflated two distinct domains because they use the same word.  Phenomenologically, truth from both domains feels like same thing.  It feels like "yes" and "right" and "that'll do."  We've come to distrust religion, because in the realm of *what is* it is a poor guide.  Rightfully so.  We've come to distrust the authority with which religion speaks on matters of morality.  Rightfully so.  We can't pretend that all religious doctrine is equally wise or inspired.  Some of it, most of it perhaps, is anachronistic at best, or malevolent at worst.  But also, it contains the seeds, and often the fruit, of geniune wisdom. *What is* is our measure of truth.  What can we repeatedly observe in labratories across the earth separated by culture and context?  Surely, that is what is true.  And it is a great metric for measuring the natural world. In a nutshell, our preference for being in connection with reality and the is-ought problem combine into the epistemological smoking gun of a meaning crisis.  

To me the is-ought problem is something like a prayer I use to remind myself that there is a gulf that can never crossed through reason alone.  It is a symbol of humilitiy.  

However, importantly, objective facts do not come with a manual for how to incoporate them into your life.  They merely are.  They exist or they don't. They do not suggest interpretation on how to incorporate those facts into our lives.
Alcohol *is* poisonous to humans.  Should you drink?  If so, how often?

A 13 year old girl *is* pregnant in the course of a sexual assault.  Should she get an abortion?

They are impossibly large numbers of facts you can construct about the world.  Which facts of that impossibly large number *should* you pay attention to? Which facts of that impossibly large number should *you* pay attention to?

At face value, this is a simple category distinction.  There are two categories, is and ought. If you assume a fact, P, there is no way of reasoning to a ought, Q.  If you want to reason to an ought, Q, you have to start with some ought, P. No matter how you slice an apple you don't end up with an orange. This is so dry that you probably currently require iv fluids.  The reason it is so threatening to me is that I fell for it.  I believed, a la Sam Harris, that science could derive morality.  I bought, via Jordan Peterson that competence hierarchies' existence, was simultaneously, its justification. 

Why did I fall for it? Because despite my religion of objectivity, there is no possible way to be perfectly rational and arrive at morality from first principals.  This is what the is-ought problem taught me.  A leap of faith is required to *live* in this world. Truly. Even the basics of survival require morality.  I should get up.  I should eat. I can only reason there from the values of not wanting to die. Not wanting to die is understandable, but it isn't logically arrived at through pure reason.  It is a value.  It is assumed.  In the absense of a clearly defined moral framework, like the christianity I grew up with,  I yearned for rules to this game of life, or least good rules of thumb, or rules of thumb for generating rules of thumb.  I wanted helpful guidance on how to be a good human.  DIY wasn't cutting it for me.  However, I didn't want to believe anything based on insufficient evidence or just because a book said so, and I still don't. This is meaning of Neitzsche's Death of God. Wisdom traditions i.e. humanities most popular how to manuals have been undermined to death.  If ever there was baby in the bathwater of religion, that baby is lost to most people. This is be

## Sacred Games(and Boring ones too)

What should you do if you realize the only way you know how to know things does not apply to the most important thing in your life i.e. how to act? Do you switch from collecting evidence to flipping a coin?  Do you insist that your morality you grew up with is correct because you grew up with it?  This might be accurately described as the human condition, and the source of all moral reasoning.  I personally become intensely interested in what morality *is*.  I guess you could say old habits die hard.  

I still don't, but this brings me to the most important takeaway. *Morality or the realm of human action, or said another way, human behavior is not a purely belief centered domain.* In fact, it mostly is not. To reference John Vervaeke, and 4e Cognitive Science, propositional belief is one of four ways of knowing. There are 4 Ps of knowing, and they are arranged hierarchically, so that one requires its predecessor to build up to the next. The first way we know something is through participation. We show up.  We try.  We engage. This is genuine beginner's mind - to see a new context without the conceptual overlay that develops through experience. Eventually, through said experience we begin to formulate concepts that help us interact in the arena.  The second type of knowing a perspectival knowing.  Having occupied many perspectives through experience one begins to abstract a working model of each perspective, through the lens of context clues, I hop from one perpective, identity, or role and that affords me different patterns of action. Morality doesn't require a belief that P necessarily implies Q. It requires a program of action.
