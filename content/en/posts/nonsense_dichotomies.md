# Setting up a non-sense morality
I have a habit of occupying non-sense moralities for periods of months.  What defines non-sense morality is to establish a dichotomy(false or real), and to try fit an entire world view into said dichotomy.  Its pretty fun.  Its also maddening.  Sometimes I want to snap out of it, but alas, this is not how I am wired.  For me, as for everyone else, the only way out is through.  So lets get through this shit.

## What makes a good nonsense morality?

A good non-sense morality needs to have a grounding a popular binary.  Gay and Straight is my current one.  I never explicitly tell people the rules of the game, but its pretty obvious after about 10 minutes.  "I love how gay this cheese is.  Dude, honestly, that Jelly is straight as hell, and I not gonna put up with it."  I'll play both sides.  Gay takes on the meaning of tight, scary, cool, creepy, touching.  I think the current I'm game i'm playing is too see how many things you can make a word mean, and still have people follow what you are saying.  Honestly, the word gay kills.  It cracks people up?  Why?  I mean it has so many meanings that it is hard to keep track.  I think can mean anything.  I think anything can mean anything.  This is the post-structuralist insight of words being defined in terms of other words meanings, so that all meanings are relative to context.

I think the game is ultimately about deconstructing binaries.  Its fun!  I think naturally skeptical people do it all the time...like...naturally.  We naturally do it naturally, dude, we naturally, *do it*, naturally, DO it, naturally, do IT, naturally, do it, naturally, duet, naturallydoit,...like, *naturally*. And that's why we're gay as fuck, and that's why all the girls fucking love us and we get mad pussy dude.

What you are thinking about?  

You *vibin* yet. Are you feeling *gay* bro? Nice.  Sick, bro.

Other important qualities for your non-sense dichotomy is to have real tactile quality to the words, and for the words to be 1 syllable, at most two.  You want to be able to quickly fashion your non-sense category to all manner of MOLL-e modular and tactical gear.  You want to be able to deploy your non-sense at a moments notice.  No funny business.  Because when the sugar turns to shit.  You have to be ready to act, and fast, *BUCKO*.

### Potential non-sense dichotomies
* High - Low: making sure you are paying attention, and remember what a dichotomy is.
* Flex - Dip: I don't mean to dip on you like my favorite cone, but these flexers are are rock hard...and here to bone.

* Lone - Bone: navarone.

Obviously, the non-sense part is important

## Getting Honked off

We all love to spew explatives into the ether, but sometimes, its too much.  Saying, "Dude, fuck gravity" has so many connotations that are unintended. Especially if you YELL IT.  *Fuck* has all the trauma of everyone who has ever yelled at you pre-packaged into it.  And that's my thing.  I LOVE TO YELL.  So I REALLY don't want people to take me seriously when I do it.  THEREFORE, you *gotta*, and I'm being serious when I say this, (leans in Men's Warehouse commercial style) you gotta come up with some non-sense swears to start throwing around.

My non-sense mot du l'ete is Honk.  

Honk Examples

"Go honk yourself."  
"We are getting honked up tonight"
"I haven't honked in 9 days."
"Honk yeah, I'm gay, dude."
"How in the honk?"
And my personal favorite, good old fashioned cholocate ice cream, "HONK!" said in anger, rage, ecstasy, but mostly goof, and always fun.  (Please don't cum and actually say "honk", that would be fucking gross. (JK do what you want :D ))

Nothing means everything. Everything means nothing. Some things means some things, and nothing means your straight. 

Where are you?  

"I had to get the honk(or straight), out of my system, 
*out of my system*
*out of my system*"

### Non-sense Swear examples
Well, being that i'm in favor of full-non-sense silly-goosery, i'm thinking that I'll have to change the rules of the Honk after honking to a new honk. (if you know what i'm honkin' about?)

I think I have to play with the form a little bit.  Honk is too vanilla a non-sense swear.  I need more complicated expression.  I need a more serious non-sense.

I need Helvetica.

I need gerund.

I think I need a Gundam.

*What is the Forest Gump of Non-sense?*

*What is the Citezen-Cane of non-sense*

And with that, I leave you friends

*"See ya Space Honkboy"*
